Consider a CFG with each terminal and non-terminal represented as single alphabet and each production is represented as a string with left most symbol as left side variable of the production. Write a program to eliminate useless symbols, â‚¬ - productions and unit productions. From the resultant grammar remove immediate left recursion. Display the input and output grammars in a readable notation.
