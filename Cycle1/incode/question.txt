Write flex and bison specifications to generate intermediate code in the form of three address code statements for a subset of C language with the following functionalities:

 --Entire program consists of only main() function. There are no other functions.
 --All identifiers are of integer (signed and unsigned) or float type only.
 --All floats are represented as num.num
 --In case of mixed mode, the integers are to be explicitly converted to floats.
 --Variables, where ever necessary are initialized by assignment only. No values are explicitly read.
 --Boolean values are considered like in C language
 --Binary operators: +, -, *, /, % and @(exponentiation)
 --Ternary Operator: ?:
 --Assignment operators : =, +=, -=, *=, /=
 --Relational operators: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, !=
 --Logical operators: &amp;&amp;, ||, !
 --Bitwise operators: |, &amp;, !
 --Conditional statements: if(E)S; and if(E) S1; else S2;
 --Iterative Constructs: while(E)S; and for(e1;e2;e3)S;
