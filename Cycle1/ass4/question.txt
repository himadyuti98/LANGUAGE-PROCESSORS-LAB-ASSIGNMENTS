Write a program to encrypt the text using lex. Copy a text file with some predefined words as special and encrypt the text as follows:
 --Special words have to be rotated right by two positions (cyclic) and written right to left.
 --Other English words should be encrypted by replacing each character by ASCII + k-cyclic and words need to be written in reverse.
 --Each number should be replaced by a new number which is generated by swapping left half and right half of the number. If the number has odd number of digits, the middle digit should be at the same place
 --All other characters have to be retained as it is except the sequence of whitespaces
which need to be replaced by single space.
